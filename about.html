        <p>In Madison, I am a member of the <a href="https://grahamgroup.wiscweb.wisc.edu">Graham Group</a>, advised by <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/che/Faculty/Graham_Michael">Mike Graham</a>. I work at the intersection of fluid mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and machine learning to better understand and control turbulence. I am using ideas from nonlinear dynamics and machine learning to form a dynamical theory of turbulence, which can be leveraged to mitigate the undesired properties of turbulence.</p>
        <p>At Princeton, I was advised by <a href="https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/rowley">Clancy Rowley</a> and <a href="https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/smits">Lex Smits</a>. There, I researched the swimming and flight of animals. I solved a 30-year-old mystery of why many swimming and flying animals flap their fins and wings the same way. For my work, I was named the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/02/14/four-win-jacobus-fellowship-princetons-top-graduate-student-honor">Porter Ogden Jacobus Fellow</a>.</p>
